App setup launcher:

Core vision:
1. What is this app for?: This app will allow users to build their own apps setup to be launched for any kind of work with
   a single click.
   
2. Who is it for?: Any user that needs many apps to work, even i could use it.

3. What is done suppoused to look like: An app that allows users to build and edit a list of apps that will be launched, 
   each app will allow the use of arguments to run apps under specific settings. The apps list can be editted so users can
   add, remove or change the order of the apps to be launched as well as its arguments and number of instances to be launched.

	2. launch.cs: Launch window script.
	3. apps_setup.cs: Entry list window script.
	4. app.cs: App entry structure script.
	5. app_create.cs: App entry creation window script.
	6. app_view.cs: App entry view and edit window.

[12/2/2025 12:16pm]: App entry creation UI was designed.

[12/2/2025 13:57pm]: App entry creation form was implemented and can navigate between 'Launch', 'App setup' and

[12/2/2025 14:19pm]: A new instance of app can be created using the 'Add' button in the setup form. No serialization,
					 , edition, removal or view functionallity has been implemented yet.
					 
[12/2/2025 14:24pm]: App information is now displayer when adding a new app to be validated before adding it to the
					 app setup list.
					 
[12/2/2025 14:50pm]: Serialization system was written but needs to be tested.

[12/2/2025 15:03pm]: Serialization system has been tested and is fully implemented.

[12/2/2025 15:06pm]: Implemented logic that disables the launch button when no app setup data was found on boot.

[12/2/2025 18:41pm]: App panels on the setup list are now properly placed.

[12/2/2025 19:03pm]: App edition logic is now beign implemented, update logic on serialization system is not updating data
					 though.
					 
[12/3/2025 11:46am]: App entry creation form UI was re-designed in order to make it compatible for editing entries.

[12/3/2025 11:51am]: App entry creation form UI changes were succesfully implemented. 

[12/3/2025 12:02am]: App entry edition logic was succesfully implemented.

[12/3/2025 12:11pm]: App entry deletion logic was succesfully implemented.

[12/3/2025 12:29pm]: App order switch logic was succesfully implemented.

[12/3/2025 12:42pm]: Basic confirmation dialogs were implemented for entries delete or update operations.

[12/3/2025 12:56pm]: Further app setup validation was implemented, so launch button will be disabled if no app data
					 is found and will be enabled back if app data is found every time the launch form is focused.

[12/3/2025 13:07pm]: Main launch logic was implemented and apps can now be launched properly. Further tests are needed.

[12/3/2025 13:40pm]: 'About' section was designed and is now implemented.

[12/3/2025 15:46pm]: Exception handling was implemented in launch logic.

[12/3/2025 15:48pm]: Every operation functionallity is now implemented, ASL - App setup launcher can now be used.
					 Further testing needed.
					 UI styles could be useful.
					 
[12/3/2025 19:56pm]: Many improvements have been made:
					 1. UI has been improved so it doesnt look like a generic windows app.
					 2. The previous launch validation which included checking if the setup was empty everytime the main
					    launch window was rendered, has been updated to a more simplistic and optimized solution which is
						validate when the user click the 'Launch button'.
					 3. Tooltips were added on the app creation/edition form to bring users further explanation without
					    displaying all the information at once. This helps keep a minimalistic UI design.
					 4. A "Empty setup" message is now displayed in the app setup window when no app data is found.
					 
					 TO DO:
					 1. Exception handling window will be updated to be a modal window, so users may not lose focus on this
					    exception warnings until they press the "OK" button.
					 2. Design a multiple app setup support system and implement it if possible.

[12/4/2025 12:34pm]: Exception handling window was updated to be a modal window.

[12/4/2025 13:59pm]: Multiple app setup support system was designed. Implementation is on the way.
					 
					 TO DO:
					 1. Implement new serialization system design.
					 
					 2. An selection box will be added to the launch window to select an app setup to launch. Last app 
						setup selection will be remembered.
					 
					 3. If no app setup is selected when user clicks 'Launch apps' or 'View apps setup' a pop up message
						will show up saying something like: "You havent selected an app setup yet, please select one.".
					 
					 4. If no app setup has been created when user clicks 'Launch apps' or 'View apps setup' a pop up
						message will show saying something like: "No app setup data was found, would you like to 
						create one?".
						
					 5. A new app setup creation form will be created.
					 
					 6. An app setup name field will be added to the app setup window as well as a button to appy changes
					    made to the setup name.

[12/4/2025 14:00pm]: A new class named 'AppSetup' was created.

[12/4/2025 15:59pm]: New serialization system has been implemented.
					 Selection box was added to launch window.
					 Launch logic was updated to fit the new serialization system.
					 
					 TO DO:
					 1. Implement dropdown and create setup button functionallity in setup creation window.

[12/4/2025 17:29pm]: Dropdown selection event logic has been implemented.

[12/4/2025 20:18pm]: TO DO:
					 Make last selected setup be remembered, an out of range exception is beign thrown.
					 Test app creation, editing, deletion and switch ordering.
					 
[12/5/2025 12:25pm]: The bug that made the launch window throw an out of bounds has been fixed.
					 A 'Edit setup' button has been added to allow users to modify a setup name.
					 
[12/5/2025 12:28pm]: The 'EditSetup' function has been implemented. It will open the 'Create setup' window which will
					 be updated to recognize when the user is editing or creating a new setup. This will make the code
					 a little bit simplier.
					 This logic that will make the 'Create setup' window recognize ediding and creation is still to be
					 implemented though.
					 
[12/5/2025 12:57pm]: App setups can now be edited as well.
					 There is a bug that when an app setup is deleted the combo box will not refresh so it still displays
					 the previously deleted setup. If that option is selected a null exception will be thrown.
					 
[12/5/2025 12:57pm]: The bug that prevented the setups list to be refreshed after deleting a setup has been fixed.
					 Further tests have taken place and a new but has been found when deleten an app from a setup.
					 
[12/5/2025 14:22pm]: The ASL - App setup launcher is now fully functional.
					 TO DO:
						1. Update the 'about' section to include information about new features.

[12/5/2025 14:38pm]: A new 'about' description has been designed.

[12/5/2025 15:55pm]: App container auto scroll is not working, needs to be fixed.

[12/5/2025 19:33pm]: App container is now scrollable.
					 App setup window flashes a little when refreshing over a certain number of apps and lists.
					 
[12/5/2025 20:11pm]: Flickering in apps container needs to be fixed (If possible). A possible code fixing it has been placed
					 in notepad.
					 
[12/8/2025 13:52pm] The project: 'ASL - App setup launcher' can now be considered finished.
					The flickering effect when opening the setup window is gone, now it takes a little pause (around 1 second) 
					while loading due to a little stress when creating and placing the controls dynamically. But that can be
					accepted.
